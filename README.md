# **Machine Learning Supervised Classification Project**
Predictive Classification Model using Oversampling and Neural Networks

##**Purpose of project: Detecting Spam Messages**

### **Type of Project:**
Building a Predictive Classification Model to detect Spam messages with high accuracry, precision, and recall.

### **Steps for the project**
* Vectorize the Text Data iwth TF-IDF

* Use Oversampling to balance classes using RandomOverSampler

* Trained a classifier on the resampled data using Logistic Regression

Then, compare results using a Neural Network. ***Which approach would be better***?

* Applied Text Tokenization and Padding to convert email text into sequences of words

* Truncate them to equal length to put into a neural network

* Compiled and trained the model
